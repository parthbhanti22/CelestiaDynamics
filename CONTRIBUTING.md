# Contributing to Celestia Dynamics

First off, thank you for showing interest in this project! As this is a proprietary educational tool, we handle contributions a bit differently than standard open-source projects.

## How Can I Help?

### 🐛 Bug Reports
If you find a scientific inaccuracy in a simulation or a technical glitch in the UI:
1. Check if the issue already exists in our tracking.
2. Open a new issue with a clear title and description.
3. Include your browser version and device type (Mobile/Desktop).

### 💡 Feature Requests
Have an idea for a new physics simulation (e.g., General Relativity, Fluid Dynamics, or String Theory)? We'd love to hear it! Please open an issue labeled `enhancement`.

### 📝 Scientific Feedback
Since this is an educational platform, accuracy is paramount. If you are a physicist or educator and notice a discrepancy in the LaTeX derivations or the simulation physics, please reach out.

## Development Standards
If you are invited to contribute code (as a collaborator):
- **Code Style**: We use strict TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- **Performance**: 3D simulations must maintain 60 FPS on mid-range mobile devices.
- **UI/UX**: Follow the "Cosmic Noir" aesthetic (Slate-950 backgrounds, Cyan/Magenta accents).

## Code of Conduct
Please be respectful and professional in all interactions. We aim to foster a community that is passionate about science and technology.
